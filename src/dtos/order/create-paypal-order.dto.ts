  // - CAPTURE. The merchant intends to capture payment immediately after the customer makes a payment.
  // - AUTHORIZE. The merchant intends to authorize a payment and place funds on hold after the customer makes a payment.

  // You must make a separate request to capture payments on demand.
  // This intent is not supported when you have more than one `purchase_unit` within your order.
